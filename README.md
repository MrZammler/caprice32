Caprice32 - Amstrad CPC Emulator
(c) Copyright 1997-2004 Ulrich Doewich

Caprice32 is a software emulator of the Amstrad CPC 8bit home computer
series. The emulator faithfully imitates the CPC464, CPC664, and CPC6128
models. By recreating the operations of all hardware components at a low
level, the emulator achieves a high degree of compatibility with original
CPC software. These programs or games can be run unmodified at real-time
or higher speeds, depending on the emulator host environment.

This version is based on the last 4.2.0 release from Ulrich Doewich that
is found in http://sourceforge.net/projects/caprice32/. I've cloned it 
here, just to play around with it and maybe add a thing or two. I'll also
try to document some of it's keys shortcuts and provide some info on it's
configuration.

Please see docs/INSTALL.txt for compiling and installing and
docs/USAGE.txt for configuring and running the emulator. (Note: WIP)
